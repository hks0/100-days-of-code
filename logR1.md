## Day 0 (Jan 6)

Looking at a course part of OSSU on edX. (https://tinyurl.com/ydnff3au). It is called How to Code: Simple Data.

It explores basic math and using Dr Racket for programming. Pretty easy and concise so far. 

OSSU has alot of content and should keep me busy for a few weeks. It mentions taking several years to complete all the coursework but I think it will be much faster if spending 1-2 hours per day.

Watched 2 talks so far. Also listened to some Darknet Diaries at work it is a great podcast. Pretty hooked.

I also got git back installed locally as well as my 100 days repo so that I can practice using the command line and git. 

Still trying to organize all the resources and everything. There is so much it is hard to find a good place to start. A rough idea of the next few months would be the following:

- OSSU - Dedicated for the next 30 days ./
- Networks - Few weeks (Probably get Raspberry Pi 4 to tinker with)
- Start making my own projects and messing with them
- Explore CTFs/Hack Sites (Hack the box, hack this site etc) \
Total: 5 months (May ETA)

__Let's keep this train rolling.__

## Day 1 

This will officially start January, Friday 10th.
