# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Huston Hollister]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Probably going to shoot for 365 days. Started on [Wednesday, January 9, 2019].

## Log

## Day 0 (Jan 8)
Decided on basic curriculum for next month or so.
The following topics will be explored:
- basic programming practices
- computer architecture (textbooks: computer architecture & operating system concepts)
- javascript

## Day 1 (Jan 9)

Learning git. Set up remote repository and beginning to familiarize myself with git and git bash.

Practiced git with vscode.

## Day 2 (Jan 10)

Continue with git and vscode. Will explore one of the following:
- Basic HTML/JS
- Computer architecture (textbooks: computer architecture & operating system concepts)

Starting late... Played around with Wacom Intuos Draw tablet for diagramming, pseudocode etc. 
It is quite enjoyable to use. 

Started Basic HTML examples on freeCodeCamp; need to look more into anchors because I'm slightly confused. 

Testing vscode terminal.

#### TLDR; 

- More git/vscode. Using git bash inside of vscode.
- Basic HTML exercises, need to practice.

### Day 3 (Jan 11)

Not much coding today.. Able to double up on day 4 though.

Did check a bit of HTML and CSS before I start looking at JS. Basically now I am organizing my Day 4.

### Day 4 (Jan 12)

Expecting around 8 hours today (maybe split 50/50 coding/research, respectively)

Some topics to explore:
- HTML & CSS first. Perhaps the Design and Build Websites book.
- JS. This is the goal, but want to understand the basics first. I have numerous textbooks to check out, which should be plenty. 
- Spitballing, but could check out some pen testing, or other books like Clean Code or Code Complete.
- Plan curriculum based on CompTIA exam topics.
