# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Huston Hollister]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Probably going to shoot for 365 days. Started on [Wednesday, January 9, 2019].

## Log

## Day 0 (Jan 8)
Decided on basic curriculum for next month or so.
The following topics will be explored:
- basic programming practices
- computer architecture (textbooks: computer architecture & operating system concepts)
- javascript

## Day 1 (Jan 9)

Learning git. Set up remote repository and beginning to familiarize myself with git and git bash.

Practiced git with vscode.

## Day 2 (Jan 10)

Continue with git and vscode. Will explore one of the following:
- Basic HTML/JS
- Computer architecture (textbooks: computer architecture & operating system concepts)

Starting late... Played around with Wacom Intuos Draw tablet for diagramming, pseudocode etc. 
It is quite enjoyable to use. 

Started Basic HTML examples on freeCodeCamp; need to look more into anchors because I'm slightly confused. 

Testing vscode terminal.

#### TLDR; 

- More git/vscode. Using git bash inside of vscode.
- Basic HTML exercises, need to practice.

## Day 3 (Jan 11)

Not much coding today.. Able to double up on day 4 though.

Did check a bit of HTML and CSS before I start looking at JS. Basically now I am organizing my Day 4.

## Day 4 (Jan 12)

Planning for 8-12 hours today (maybe split 50/50 coding/research, respectively).

Some topics to explore:
- HTML & CSS first. Perhaps the Design and Build Websites book.
- JS. This is the goal, but want to understand the basics first. I have numerous textbooks to check out, which should be plenty. 
- Spitballing, but could check out some pen testing, or other books like Clean Code or Code Complete.
- Plan curriculum based on CompTIA exam topics.

Today, I have made it through the first 7 chapters of Head First HTML and CSS (~270 pages). I have really enjoyed the book thus far. The first chapters were mostly HTML, but CSS is being introduced now.

I've learned:
- HTML syntax such as elements, attributes, and how to use multiple elements in some scenarios (linking to img on other websites, alt text for img, how to set ids and href directly to them [< a href="https://blahblahlink.com/folder/randomimg.png">TextforLink</a >])
- correct ways to structure my tags; differences between inline/block elements
- very basic CSS, just starting the chapter
